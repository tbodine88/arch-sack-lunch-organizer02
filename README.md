# Manage charity sack lunch church committee communications

First Unitarian Universalist Church of Austin has a set of Sack Lunch
committees, one per week, that prepare lunches for Austin Resource
Center for the Homeless.  Committee members receive reminders a few
days before the meeting.  When they recieve a reminder, members select
what items they will contribute to the lunches. Another reminder to each
member of the committee, it goes out the day before the meeting listing
who is coming and what they are bringing.

This site will facilitate the process.

* Provides a central place where people can record what they are bringing
* Group Facilitators can add members  to their group
* Group Facilitators can add items to the list of things to bring for lunches
* People can join or leave committees
